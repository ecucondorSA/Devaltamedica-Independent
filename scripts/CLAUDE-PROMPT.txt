CLAUDE AI DIAGNOSTIC PROMPT

Problem: GitHub Actions failing due to missing scripts
Root Cause: analyze-code.js and hotspot-scan.js were missing
Solution: Created functional scripts with proper parameter handling

Files Created:
- scripts/analyze-code.js (code analysis with timeouts)
- scripts/hotspot-scan.js (pattern detection)
- scripts/CLAUDE-BEACON.md (diagnostic report)

Workflow Fixed:
- Updated parameter format in ai-code-review.yml
- Added timeouts to prevent hanging
- Simplified execution paths

Status: RESOLVED - GitHub Actions should now pass
