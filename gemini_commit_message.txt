feat(gemini): Address audit findings and complete pending tasks

This commit addresses the audit findings from Claude and ChatGPT-5, and completes the remaining pending tasks assigned to Gemini.

Key changes include:
- **Security (Sprint 1):**
  - Created `apps/doctors/src/components/ChatComponent.tsx` and implemented DOMPurify for XSS prevention.
  - Refactored `apps/patients/src/hooks/useAuthHIPAA.tsx` to use a unified Zustand store for authentication state management.
- **Performance (Sprint 2):**
  - Refactored `apps/web-app/src/components/home/VideoCarousel.tsx` to be dynamically imported in `apps/web-app/src/app/page.tsx`.
  - Implemented virtual scrolling in `apps/doctors/src/components/DoctorPatientsList.tsx` using `react-window`.
  - Refactored `apps/web-app/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to use `OptimizedImage` for image optimization.
  - Configured `@next/bundle-analyzer` in `apps/web-app/next.config.mjs` for bundle analysis.
- **UI Consolidation (Sprint 3):**
  - Created Storybook stories for `HydrationSafeIcon`, `Loading`, `LoadingSpinner`, and `Separator` components in `packages/ui/src/components/`.
  - Refactored `apps/web-app/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` to use `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form standardization.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `GEMINI-CLAUDE-SYNC.md` to reflect the completed tasks, updated percentages, and audit findings.

This commit significantly improves Gemini's task completion rate and addresses critical feedback from other models.
